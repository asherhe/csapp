# `howManyBits`

This folder contains solutions to `howManyBits`.

- `howManyBits1.c` is a very high-level approach to the problem, using binary search within a `while` loop.
- `howManyBits2.c` is a bit of a lower-level implementation, with the `while` loop expanded out to five repeated expressions
- `howManyBits3.c` further expands the program by breaking apart the `if` loops
