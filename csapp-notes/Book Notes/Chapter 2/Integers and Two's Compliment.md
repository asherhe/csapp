# Integers and Two's Compliment

#chapter-2 #2s-compliment #data-types

- A system for representing negative numbers as well as positive numbers
- Defined so that traditional addition and subtraction still make mathematical sense
  - There is no need to introduce a new framework for accounting for signed numbers

## First of all, some terminology

| Symbol | Type | Meaning |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| $B2T_w$ | Function | Binary to two's compliment |
| $B2U_w$ | Function | Binary to unsigned |
| $U2B_w$ | Function | Unsigned to binary |
| $U2T_w$ | Function | Unsigned to two's compliment |
| $T2B_w$ | Function | Two's compliment to binary |
| $T2U_w$ | Function | Two's compliment to unsigned |
| $TMin_w$ | Constant | Minimum two's-compliment value |
| $TMax_w$ | Constant | Maximum two's compliment value |
| $UMax_w$ | Constant | Maximum unsigned value |
| $+^t_w$ | Operation | Two's-compliment addition |
| $+^u_w$ | Operation | Unsigned addition |
| $*^t_w$ | Operation | Two's-compliment multiplication |
| $*^u_w$ | Operation | Unsigned multiplication |
| $-^t_w$ | Operation | Two's-compliment negation |
| $-^u_w$ | Operation | Unsigned negation |

## Unsigned Integers

Your run-of the mill binary numbers

A vector $\overrightarrow x=\left[x_{w-1},x_{w-2},\cdots,x_0\right]$ would represent::

$$
B2U_w\left(\overrightarrow x\right)\doteq\sum^{w-1}_{i=0}x_i2^i
$$

($\doteq$ meaning that the left-hand side is defined to be equal to the right-hand side - kind of like a definition)

So the maximum number $UMax_w$ corresponds to the bit vector $[11\cdots1]$ while the minimum is (a bit obviously) $[00\cdots0]$.

Anyways, we can express $UMax_w$ as $UMax_w\doteq\sum^{w-1}_{i=0}2^i=2^w-1$

$B2U_w$ is also a *bijection*, meaning that a vector can be converted into an unsigned integer and vice versa. The opposite function is called $U2B_w$.

## Signed Integers

#2s-compliment

In order to represent signed integers, the most significant bit in two's compliment is negated, which offsets the whole thing. Thus we have:

$$
B2T_w(\overrightarrow x)\doteq-x_{w-1}2^{w-1}+\sum^{w-2}_{i=0}x_i2^i
$$

**#todo Add that diagram from the lecture with the number line and arrows showing how this works visually - see Figure 2.13 (p. 65) in the book**

So the minimum value is $[100\cdots0]$ (set the negative bit on), which is equal to $TMin_w\doteq-2^{w-1}$, and the maximum value is $[011\cdots1]$, which is equal to $TMax_w\doteq\sum^{w-2}_{i=0}2^i=2^{w-1}-1$.

## Signed â†” Unsigned conversions

Due to the completely different nature of signed and unsigned numbers, defining a way to convert between signed and unsigned numbers is a bit hard. The ranges of signed and unsigned numbers do not coincide, and behaviour for unrepresentable numbers is not clear. Should negative numbers be rounded as zero? Should too-large numbers just straight up be written as $TMax$?.

How C does it is a little weird. Instead of doing any conversions, it just points to the number and says, "this is `unsigned` now". So for example, when we ask C to make `-12345` unsigned, it just treats the value `0xCFC7` as unsigned. This would just be `53191`, which is a bit strange considering that it was just negative mere seconds ago.

Basically we can define $T2U\left(x\right)\doteq B2U\left(T2B\left(x\right)\right)$ and vice versa.

Alternatively, since the conversion is equivalent to moving the negative numbers over to the too-large numbers, we can define it as:

$$
T2U_w(x)=\begin{cases}
x+2^w,&x<0\\
x,&x\ge0
\end{cases}
$$
