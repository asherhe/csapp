| ------- | ---------- |
| Black | White |
| Blue | Yellow |
| Green | Magenta |
| Cyan | Red |
| Red | Cyan |
| Magenta | Green |
| Yellow | Blue |
| White | Black |

**Blue | Green = Cyan**

Has the effect of kind of "mixing" two colors

**Yellow & Cyan = Green**

Only green is common to these two.
This resembles the effect of colored glass

**Red ^ Magenta = Blue**
