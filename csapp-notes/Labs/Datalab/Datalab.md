# Datalab

#lab #datalab #chapter-2

The first of the many labs in the CS:APP course, Datalab will test your ingenuity and problem-solving skills in a set of 13 problems of increasing difficulty. In this lab, you will learn how to skillfully and elegantly manipulate integer and floating-point numeric data types

## Problems (Listed in order)

*italics* = quite difficult
**Section 1**

1. [[bitXor]] - making [[Boolean Algebra#Exclusive Or XOR|XOR]] with [[Boolean Algebra#And|AND]] and [[Boolean Algebra#Not|NOT]]
2. [[tMin]] - return minimum [[Integers and Two's Compliment]] integer

**Section 2**

1. [[isTmax]] - verify that a number is the largest [[Integers and Two's Compliment]] number
2. [[allOddBits]] - verify that an integer's odd bits are all 1
3. [[negate]] - arithmetic negation

**Section 3**

1. [[isAsciiDigit]] - check if a ASCII character is within the range representing numeric digits (`'0'` to `'9'`)
2. [[conditional]] - simple `if`
3. *[[isLessOrEqual]] - `>=` operation*
4. [[logicalNeg]] - implement the ever-so-helpful `!` ([[Boolean Algebra#Bitwise vs Logical|logical]] [[Boolean Algebra#Not|negation]]) operator
5. *[[howManyBits]] - calculates the minimum amount of two's compliment bits needed to represent an integer*

**Floating-point stuff**

1. [[floatScale2]] - implement "times two" operator
2. [[floatFloat2Int]] - turn floating-point value to an integer (truncate the decimal points)
3. [[floatPower2]] - integer powers of 2 in floating point (hint: `exp`)
